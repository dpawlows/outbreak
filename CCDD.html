  <h4>Three roads to disaster</h4>

    <p>During a recent outbreak, a survivor, Devon, made it to safety in Salzburg after walking nearly 100 miles through the Austrian countryside.  At one point, she encountered a fork in the road where her options where to go left, right, or up and onto the highway.  A sign on the entrance ramp to the highway read “Not this way”.  Another sign that pointed to the left read “Safety here, or else you should go right!”.  Finally, the sign for the road to the right read “Infected on highway”.  It was clear that these notices had been there for a few days so Devon knew at least one of them had to be false.

    <p>Which way did Devon go, right, left or highway?</p>
