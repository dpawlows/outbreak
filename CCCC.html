  <h4>Operatives:</h4>

    <p>We recently found multiple pieces of evidence to suggest that a bio-terrorist
      cell is behind the outbreak in the Ann Arbor area.  Further,
      the leader of this cell is none other than the infamous Bo D'Odur.
      I know you all know of Mr. D'Odur's reputation.
</p>
<p> One of the items that we discovered was some sort of encrypted message, which
  is provided below.  We need you to decipher this message as we believe
  that it will provide us with a clue to the location of another
  potential outbreak.  We know that in the past, this cell has used a
  variety of encrption techniques, including Vigenere and substitution ciphers,
  as well as encoding data in hexidecimal or binary.  We recommend using
  any resources that you have at your disposal, including Google, to decode
  the message.
</p>
<p>I don't need to remind you of the additional danger
  that we face now that we know that Bo D'Odur's cell is involved in this.
  We know that he is in the area actively infecting residents with
  the Mersa 5 and Crebs virus.  Also, we believe that
  he is testing a new, leathal, version of the Chickungunya virus.
   He was recently spotted wearing a yellow-knit hat.  Be on the lookout
   for this individual and if you see him, avoid at all costs.
</p>

    <p>Here is the message that our agents found:</p>

    <p>
      <pre>Gentlemen,

          Once there, you will need the user (Kerrytown solution; 2 digits)
          and password (JG; 5 letters uppercase).

      </p>
      <p>Again, let us know as soon as you decode the message.  Decoding this
        message will not cure the infection at this location, but is necessary
        to eventually find a cure.
      </p>
      <p>Text the answer to the CDC organizers along with a selfie.  Make sure
        that you have the proper personel in the photo.</p>
