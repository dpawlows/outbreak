  <h4>Four drunk hikers</h4>

    <p>Four people come to a river in the night: Jen, Lorianne, Aaron and Sean. There is a narrow bridge, but it can only hold two people at a time. They have one torch and, because it's night, the torch has to be used when crossing the bridge. Jen can cross the bridge in 1 minute, Lorianne in 2 minutes, Aaron in 5 minutes, and Sean in 8 minutes. When two people cross the bridge together, they must move at the slower person's pace.  What is the shortest amount of time it takes to get all 4 people across?</p>

    <p>Answer this in a table format:</p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Direction (Across or Return)</th>
        <th>People crossing</th>
        <th>Time</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Across</td>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Return</td>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>...</td>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
