    <p>At a previous outbreak in Showa, in the Fukushima province of Japan, a virus wiped out 99.9% of the population.  One survivor, weâ€™ll call her Beth, left the ruins of the CDC station and traveled just 7 miles on her first day heading towards safety.  Thereafter, her progress improved steadily by 4 miles per day and eventually, on the day she completed 51 miles of travel, she contracted the virus and died.
</p>

    <p>For how many days had Beth been traveling when she died?</p>
