    <p>I knew this mom once who was a bit out there.
      One day I was playing with her son Matt, and she came up to
      him and said “Matthew, you have been condemned to death.  I’m sorry.
      This is a terrible situation.  To make it worse, your captor is a
      cruel man.  In a false show of mercy, he allows you to decide the room
      in which you’ll die.  One room is engulfed by a fire that never stops
      burning, another holds a bengal tiger that hasn’t eaten in a year, and
      the third is filled with his most violent soldiers.
</p>

    <p>Which room do you choose and why?</p>

  <p>Text the answer to the CDC organizers along with a selfie.  Make sure
    that you have the proper personel in the photo.</p>
