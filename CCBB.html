  <h4>Wolf and sheep and Steve</h4>

    <p>A man named Steve arrives at a riverbank with a wolf, a sheep and a bucket of Mexican Cokes.  There is only one boat available to take Steve across and he can only bring a single item with him as he crosses in the boat.  If he leaves the wolf alone with the sheep, the wolf will eat it.  If he leaves the sheep alone with the Coke, the sheep will drink them all and Steve will get mad and kill the sheep.
      What is the fewest number of crossings required (and how does he do it) so Steve crosses the
      river with the wolf, sheep and coke all intact?</p>

    <p>Answer this in a table format:</p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Direction (Across or Return)</th>
        <th>Things crossing</th>
        <th></th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Across</td>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Return</td>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>...</td>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
