  <h4>Operatives</h4>
  <p>We recently recovered the body of someone that we believe was
    working with Bo D'Odur's cell.  It appears that this person
    contracted Mersa 5, probably on accident, and suffered the
    consequences.  We discovered a note on his body that includes
    an encrypted message, displayed below.  Our technicians have seen these
    messages before.  It seems that this type of technique is often
    called an "ice cream truck" problem in the field.  The idea is this:
  </p>
  <p>
    Each circle represents a neighborhood.  Each line is a street that
    connects the neighborhoods.  In this encrpytion problem, the key
     to decoding the message is to imagine that you are running an ice cream
    truck company, where your goal is to be able to serve
    ice cream to all neighborhoods.
    If you place an ice cream truck in one neighborhood, all others that are
    directly connected to that one by a single road is then being served.
    The trick is to figure out which neighborhoods in which to place a
    truck.  </p>
    <p>In this problem, a message has been hidden using this concept.  The
      only way to figure out the message (unless you have the key) is to
      determine the fewest ice cream trucks necessary such that all neighborhoods
      are served and their locations.  You will know that you have succeeded
      if you position the trucks such that all neighborhoods are being served
      by exactly 1 truck.</p>
      <p>We believe that this message is vital and will count as <b>double</b>
        in uncovering the cure to the
        Mersa 5 infection.  Update us as soon as you have a solution.</p>
